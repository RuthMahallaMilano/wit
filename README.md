# Wit

Wit is a version control system that simulates Git's behavior, which includes commands such as add, branch, commit, status, and checkout. I also implemented a basic merge and graph, which is a kind of graphical log.

In order to run Wit, the follow the next steps:
1. git clone the repo
2. create a vitrual environnment
3. install the requirements fron requirenents.txt file
4. install the packeges of the project (using "pip install -e .")
5. go to the folder you want to beckup and set as a Wit repository
6. to start a repository, run "python <path>\wit\project\wit.py init"
7. you can always run "python <path>\wit\project\wit.py -- help" to see all possible commands
